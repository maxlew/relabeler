_Note:_ This repo was pretty much entirely generated by ChatGPT/Cursor, bar some tweaks to use ESM over CJS. The prompt that spawned this was.

```
Could you create me a javascript script that uses the github rest api to bulk change labels in a repo. 

I want to be able to call it via the command line and pass it a list of comma separated labels to find, and a new label to add. 

It should not remove the old label by default, but it should be an option. 

example usage 

./relabel.js --from foo,bar --to boop --api-key xxx
```

and the readme 
```
could you generate me a readme file for this repo, make it a bit humorous and include links to where to generate github api keys as well as descriptions of all the options
```

## 🤔 FAQ

### **Why is it called the relabeler?**

Because it’s a label-changing powerhouse. Enough said.

### **What happens if I mess up?**

Don’t worry, GitHub’s label system is pretty forgiving. Just run the script again to fix things.

### **Why do I need an API key?**

The GitHub REST API doesn’t trust random bots poking at their data. The API key proves you’re a human (or a sentient script with proper credentials).

This script might be too powerful for some. Handle with care. Over-relabeling can lead to _Labelception™_, where labels refer to other labels. Use responsibly, and don’t let it go to your head. 👨‍🔬
