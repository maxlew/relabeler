_Note:_ This repo was pretty much entirely generated by ChatGPT/Cursor, bar some tweaks to use ESM over CJS. The prompt that spawned this was.

```
Could you create me a javascript script that uses the github rest api to bulk change labels in a repo. 

I want to be able to call it via the command line and pass it a list of comma separated labels to find, and a new label to add. 

It should not remove the old label by default, but it should be an option. 

example usage 

./relabel.js --from foo,bar --to boop --api-key xxx
```

and the readme 
```
could you generate me a readme file for this repo, make it a bit humorous and include links to where to generate github api keys as well as descriptions of all the options
```

    cd relabeler
    ```

4. **Get a GitHub API Key**:  
   You’ll need a GitHub personal access token with `repo` permissions.

    ./relabel.js --from "bug,help wanted" --to feature --api-key YOUR_API_KEY --repo owner/repo
    ```
    
    _Note: you'll need to quote the whole --from string if you have spaces in your labels... don't put spaces in labels kids._

## ✨ Examples

-   Add the label `awesome` to issues labeled `boring` or `meh`:

    ```bash
    ./relabel.js --from boring,meh --to awesome --api-key YOUR_API_KEY --repo owner/repo
    ```

-   Add `improved` while removing old labels `broken` and `messy`:
    ```bash
    ./relabel.js --from broken,messy --to improved --api-key YOUR_API_KEY --repo owner/repo --remove-old
    ```

## 🤔 FAQ

### **Why is it called the relabeler?**

Because it’s a label-changing powerhouse. Enough said.

### **What happens if I mess up?**

Don’t worry, GitHub’s label system is pretty forgiving. Just run the script again to fix things.

### **Why do I need an API key?**

The GitHub REST API doesn’t trust random bots poking at their data. The API key proves you’re a human (or a sentient script with proper credentials).

This script might be too powerful for some. Handle with care. Over-relabeling can lead to _Labelception™_, where labels refer to other labels. Use responsibly, and don’t let it go to your head. 👨‍🔬
